# Fire Simulation

firesim is an interactive web-based simulation that models the spread of fire through a forest under various conditions. Users can adjust parameters such as wind direction, rain level, and tree density to see how these factors influence the spread of fire. The simulation provides a visual representation of a grid of cells, each representing a portion of the forest that can be in one of several states: empty, tree, burning, or burned.      
                                                                              
### Features                                                              
                                                                              
- **Dynamic Grid**: The simulation grid represents the forest, with each cell capable of being a tree, burning, or burned.                           
- **Wind Direction**: Users can set the wind direction (North, South, East, West), which affects the spread of fire.                                    
- **Rain Level**: The simulation allows for rain levels to be set to None, Medium, or High, which affects the probability of fire spreading.           
- **Tree Density**: Users can adjust the density of trees within the forest, affecting how easily the fire can spread.                           
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, stop, and reset the simulation at any time. Users can also toggle rain on and off.                                
- **Probability Settings**: Set the probability of fire spreading in the main and opposite wind directions. The simulation calculates orthogonal and diagonal spreading probabilities based on these settings.                   
                                                                              
### How to Use                                                            
                                                                              
1. **Set Parameters**: Before starting the simulation, adjust the wind direction, rain level, tree density, and fire spreading probabilities as desired.                                                                    
2. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start Simulation" button to see how fire spreads through the forest with the current settings.
3. **Adjust Conditions**: Change the conditions (wind, rain, density) while the simulation is running to see how they affect the fire's behavior. 
4. **Reset**: Use the "Reset Grid" button to clear the grid and start a new simulation.
